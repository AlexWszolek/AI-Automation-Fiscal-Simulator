# V2 model — lever & equation reference

How every lever affects the model, as the exact equations in `fiscal_model/`. Reflects the post-accuracy-
overhaul v2 (`DynamicModelV2`). **Notation:** a *cell* = (occupation × state); `Σ` sums over cells (or
states where noted). Fiscal **losses are positive** (they worsen the deficit); recoveries subtract. `t` is
the period (year).

---

## Part 0 — The fixed per-worker channel deltas (precomputed, cached)

For each cell, displacing one worker produces a per-worker fiscal delta by channel. These are **baked once**
(scenario-invariant) into `data/interim/worker_deltas_by_occ_state.parquet` and scaled by worker counts in
the loop (`fiscal_model/kernel.py`, `rates.py`, `integrate.py`):

- **Income tax lost** (fed/state): `Δinc = T(HH) − T(HH − wage)` — exact progressive-bracket difference, per
  filing, integrated over the within-cell income distribution.
- **Payroll (FICA)**: `OASDI·min(wage,cap) + Medicare·wage + Addl·max(wage−thresh,0)` (employer+employee).
- **Consumption**: `Δcons = rate_state · marginal_taxable_multiplier · mpc · consumption_stickiness · max(0, disposable_loss)`.
- **Corporate offset** (per worker): `surplus_capture·comp → corp_tax + dividend_tax_rate·dividends + passthrough_individual_rate·pass_income`.
- **Transfers** (fed/state): `interp(income_after) − interp(income_before)` over the PolicyEngine-baked
  grids, split by FMAP `fed_share` (Medicaid 0.65, SNAP/EITC/CTC/ACA 1.0, TANF 0.5, SSI 0.95).

> **Build-time levers** (frozen in the cache): `surplus_capture, dividend_tax_rate,
> passthrough_individual_rate, mpc, consumption_stickiness, marginal_taxable_multiplier`. On a normal v2
> run with a fixed cache, **changing these does nothing to the cached channels** — they only take effect if
> the cache is rebuilt at that kernel. (Exception: `mpc` and `consumption_stickiness` *also* enter the
> lagged-demand impulse **live** — see Step 9.)

## Part 1 — The within-period sequence (period t)

### Step 1–2 · Diffusion & displacement  (`levers.py`, `workers.py`)
Per-occupation exposure→displacement fraction. The ROBOT channel ramps over `robotics_lag` years
(physical automation needs AI-built industrial capacity; ramp=1 when lag=0):
```
cog(o)   = percentile-rank(PCA)   or   1/(1+exp(−logistic_steepness·(PCA − logistic_midpoint)))
ramp_t   = min(1, t/robotics_lag)                         # 1 if robotics_lag == 0
g_cell_t = 1 − (1 − cog·cognitive_feasibility)·(1 − robot·physical_feasibility·ramp_t)
```
Cumulative diffusion **ceiling**, tracking a per-cell automated stock `auto_disp` (`workers.displacement_flow`):
```
target_t = clip(g_cell_t · adoption(t), 0, 1) · emp0      # adoption(t) = adoption_path[t] (or scalar adoption)
flow_t   = clip(target_t − auto_disp, 0, employed)        # this period's automation displacement
auto_disp += flow_t
employed −= flow_t ;  on_ui = flow_t                      # displace()
```
The t−1 SIGNED demand-controller flow lands now (Step 9 stores it; 0 at t=0):
```
positive → displace_extra (employed → induced, capped at employed)
negative → release_induced (induced → employed, capped at induced)   # stimulus re-hires
```

### Step 3–4 · Disposition router (the firm side)  (`firms/disposition.py`, `compute_pool.py`)
The automated-jobs base is the CUMULATIVE `auto_disp` (a job stays automated after its worker moves on —
reabsorption/attrition never un-automate it; induced excluded, demand layoffs save no comp):
```
saved_bill = Σ auto_disp · comp_per_worker
automation_spend = auto_cost · saved_bill
net_saving = saved_bill − automation_spend
retained_profit = retained_profit_share · net_saving      # the PRE-tax partition leg
price_reduction = price_reduction_share · net_saving
survivor_gains  = survivor_gains_share  · net_saving      # shares must sum to 1 (asserted)
corp_offset_cell = auto_disp · corp_per_worker · [retained_profit_share·(1−auto_cost) − automation_tax_rate]
```
(the robot tax is PAID from retained profit, corp-deductibly — the offset shrinks by corp_rate·tax;
`automation_tax_rate ≤ retained_profit_share·(1−auto_cost)` asserted). Compute pool:
```
offshore_leak = offshore_share · automation_spend         # shipped default 0
compute_tax   = (automation_spend − offshore_leak) · compute_effective_rate
```

### Step 5 · Survivor wage index — FUNDED W*  (`survivor.funded_w_update`)
The routed `survivor_gains` flow pays the standing raise's recurring cost FIRST; only the surplus raises
W (converging W* = 1 + gains/(ℓ·wage_bill), ceiling-capped); unfundable → W snaps to the funded level.
ℓ = comp_bill/wage_bill (~1.4) prices raises in fully-loaded comp-$:
```
wage_bill   = Σ employed · wage ;  ℓ = Σ employed·comp_pw / wage_bill
maintenance = ℓ·wage_bill·(W_mech_old − 1)
available   = survivor_gains − maintenance
if available ≥ 0:  room = ℓ·wage_bill·(ceiling − W_mech_old); increment = min(available, room)
                   overflow = available − increment;  W_mech += increment/(ℓ·wage_bill)
else:              W_mech = 1 + survivor_gains/(ℓ·wage_bill);  increment = overflow = 0    # snap
wage_cost = ℓ·wage_bill·(W_mech_new − 1)                  # = maintenance + increment
C5c (every branch, exact):  wage_cost + overflow_to_profit + overflow_to_price == survivor_gains
market_frac = survivor_elasticity · slack_prev            # slack_prev: see Step 10; 0 at t=0
W_surv   = clip(W_mech + market_frac, 0, survivor_raise_ceiling)
```
The raise is SELF-FINANCING — taxed once, as labour income (below); there is no profit netting.
Survivor tax effect (per cell, gain = revenue up), Δw = wage·(W_surv − 1):
```
sd_fed   = Σ_filing weight·[T_fed(hh+Δw) − T_fed(hh) + FICA(wage·W_surv) − FICA(wage)] · employed
sd_state = Σ_filing weight·[T_state(hh+Δw) − T_state(hh)] · employed
```
Overflow–capital coupling  (`r_corp = Σ(auto_disp·corp_pw)/saved_bill`):
```
overflow_corp_tax     = r_corp · overflow_to_profit              # extra corp recovery
price_reduction_total = price_reduction + overflow_to_price
```

### Step 6 · Macro  (`macro.py`)
```
Y    = 1 + productivity_passthrough · (saved_bill / COMP_TOTAL)   # output-weighted dividend
P    = 1 − price_passthrough · (price_reduction_total / (VA_BASE · Y))
nGDP = VA_BASE · Y · P · (1 + baseline_growth_rate)^t             # trend growth: %-GDP denominators ONLY
```
(VA_BASE = $29.3T, COMP_TOTAL = $15.0T; nominal dollar columns never see g.)

### Step 7 · Federal ledger (losses +)  (`dynamics_v2.py`)
```
fed_cell = inc_fed + payroll_fed + transfer_fed + ui_outlay − ui_tax − corp_offset_cell − sd_fed
net_fed  = Σ fed_cell − compute_tax − overflow_corp_tax
```
Reabsorbed contribution inside `inc_*/transfer_*`:
```
rung 0:  reabsorbed · reemployment_haircut · after_delta         (tax channels only — the C8 anchor)
rung 1:  reabsorbed · reab_delta[channel]                        (all 6 channels; see Step 10)
ui_outlay = on_ui · ui_benefit · ui_share  ;  ui_share = min(1, ui_weeks/52)  ;  ui_tax = 0.10·ui_outlay
```
`retired` carry NOTHING (delta-neutral — the baseline twin retired too); `exited` carry the after-loss
plus draw SSDI (Step 8.5); `induced` carry the full after-loss.

### Step 8 · State balanced-budget close (each of 51 states)  (`government.py`)
```
state_net[s]     = Σ_{cells∈s} (inc_state + cons_state + transfer_state − sd_state)
taxable_base[s]  = Σ_{cells∈s} (employed · wage · W_surv  +  reabsorbed · w_d)   # reabsorbed pay taxes too
gap[s]           = max(0, state_net[s])
cut_share        = 0 (raise_rates) | 1 (cut_spending) | state_cut_share (mix)
rate_target      = gap·(1 − cut_share)
recovered[s]     = min(rate_target, state_rate_hike_cap · taxable_base[s])
spending_cut[s]  = gap·cut_share + (rate_target − recovered)          # infeasible hike → forced cut
contraction[s]   = spending_cut[s]·MPC_GOV + recovered[s]·mpc         # MPC_GOV = 1.0 (mode-dependent)
```

### Step 8.5 · Federal policy flows  (`dynamics_v2.py`)
```
ubi_outlay     = ubi_annual · baseline_emp                   # gross outlay
ubi_recapture  = ubi_recapture_rate · ubi_outlay             # tax clawback + means-test crowd-out
automation_tax = automation_tax_rate · saved_bill            # robot tax (payer: retained profit, Step 3-4)
ssdi_outlay    = Σ exited · ssdi_annual                      # SSDI on the LFP-exited
net_fed       += ubi_outlay − ubi_recapture − automation_tax + ssdi_outlay
debt           = debt·(1 + interest_rate) + net_fed
ubi_required_rate = ubi_annual·baseline_emp·(1−recapture) / [wage_bill·W_surv + Σ reabsorbed·w_d]
```

### Step 9 · LEVEL-TARGETING demand (the stock controller; signed; one-period lag)  (`dynamics_v2.py`)
The induced stock TRACKS a target proportional to the STANDING net withdrawal — a stationary shock gives
a stationary induced stock; injections lower the target and RELEASE workers back to employed:
```
net_pw:  exhausted/induced = wage − after_inc − emp_fica − after_transfers
         exited            = the same − ssdi_annual
         on_ui             = wage − blend(inc) − emp_fica − blend(transfers) − ui·ui_share
         reabsorbed        = the take-home scar net of the transfers replacing it ;  retired = 0
hh_withdrawal = Σ stocks·net_pw − wage_bill·(W_surv−1) − ubi_outlay·(1−recapture)     [signed]
k             = demand_multiplier·mpc·stickiness / (VA_BASE/baseline_emp)
target_cell   = k·[ max(0, hh_withdrawal)·emp_share_national                          [national]
                  + contraction[s]·employed/state_emp[s] ]                            [austerity in-state]
flow          = target_cell − induced_stock              # SIGNED; applied at the START of t+1 (Step 1-2)
```
Stability: loop gain ρ = dm·mpc·stickiness·d̄/va_pw ≈ 0.1 at shipped dm=0.5 (asserted < 1 at construction).
cons_state is excluded from net_pw (it is keyed to the same take-home drop — double-count).

### Step 10 · Period end — worker transitions  (`workers.age_and_transition`)
```
pool = exhausted + on_ui                                  # the bit-identical v1-anchor arithmetic
reabsorbed += pool · reabsorption_rate ;  exited += pool · lfp_exit_rate
exhausted   = pool − pool·(reabsorption_rate + lfp_exit_rate)
induced: the SAME split in parallel (reabsorption + lfp_exit apply; demand-displaced find jobs too)
retired    += (exhausted + induced) · attrition_rate      # DELTA-NEUTRAL retirement (baseline twin too)
slack_prev  = 1 − (Σ employed + Σ reabsorbed)/(baseline − Σ retired)   # reabsorbed work; retirees left
```
**Reabsorbed destination wage** (rung 1, live engine `reabsorption.ReabsorptionEngine`):
`w_d = max(wage·(1 − reemployment_haircut), service_floor)`,  `wage_removed = wage − w_d`. The 6-channel
`reab_delta` is `T(hh)−T(hh−wage_removed)`, `FICA(wage)−FICA(w_d)`, consumption on the take-home drop, and
`interp(hh−wage_removed) − interp(hh)` for transfers. **`haircut=0 ⇒ wage_removed=0 ⇒ all channels 0`
(reabsorbed fiscally whole).**

### Reporting
```
fed_deficit_B = net_fed/1e9    fed_deficit_real_B = net_fed/P/1e9    fed_deficit_pct_gdp = 100·net_fed/nGDP
fed_deficit_abs_B = 1833 + net_fed/1e9    state_gap_B = Σ gap / 1e9
```

(`state_response`, `reabsorption_rung`, `exposure_mapping`, `denominator`, `n_periods`,
`reabsorption_floor_pctile`, the logistic shape), fields baked into caches/templates (`consumption_scale`,
`dividend_tax_rate`, `passthrough_individual_rate`, `marginal_taxable_multiplier`), the corporate-XOR pins,
